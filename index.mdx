## What is Orchard?

Orchard is a Kubernetes-native deployment platform built by Hack Club. It provides an intuitive interface for deploying containerized applications without needing to write complex Kubernetes manifests or manage cluster infrastructure directly.

## Key Features

### Container Orchestration

Deploy containers from Docker images or build directly from your GitHub repositories. Orchard handles image building, registry management, and Kubernetes deployment automatically.

### Team Collaboration

Organize your work with organizations, workspaces, and projects. Invite team members with role-based permissions and manage access across your entire infrastructure.

### Built-in Networking

Expose your applications with internal services or public ingresses. Configure custom domains with automatic TLS certificate management.

### Persistent Storage

Attach volumes to your deployments for databases, file storage, and any workloads requiring persistent data.

## How Orchard is Organized

Orchard uses a three-tier hierarchy to organize your resources:

```
Organization
└── Workspace
    └── Project
        ├── Deployments
        ├── Services
        ├── Ingresses
        └── Volumes
```

- **Organizations** are the top-level container, typically representing your team or company
- **Workspaces** group related projects together, such as by environment (production, staging) or team
- **Projects** contain your actual deployments and are isolated in their own Kubernetes namespace
