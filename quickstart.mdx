description: Deploy your first application to Orchard in under 5 minutes.
---

This guide walks you through deploying your first application to Orchard. By the end, you'll have a running container accessible via the internet.

## Prerequisites

- An invitation to an Orchard organization (Orchard is currently in closed beta)
- A Docker image to deploy, or a GitHub repository with a Dockerfile

## Step 1: Accept Your Organization Invitation

Orchard is currently in closed beta. To get started, you need to be invited to an organization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your email">
    Look for an invitation email from Orchard with a link to join an organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the invitation link">
    Click **Accept Invitation** in the email to join the organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in or create account">
    If you don't have an Orchard account yet, you'll be prompted to create one using email OTP, passkey, or Hack Club OAuth.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Don't have an invitation? Contact the Hack Club team to request access to the closed beta.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create a Workspace

Workspaces help you organize projects. You might create separate workspaces for production and staging, or for different teams.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your organization">
    Click on your newly created organization from the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workspace">
    Click **New Workspace** and enter a name (e.g., "production" or "development").
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Create a Project

Projects are where your deployments live. Each project gets its own Kubernetes namespace for isolation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your workspace">
    Click on the workspace you just created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a project">
    Click **New Project** and provide a name for your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Deploy Your Application

You can deploy from a Docker image or directly from a GitHub repository.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a new deployment">

      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure your deployment">
        - **Name**: A unique name for this deployment
        - **Image**: The Docker image to deploy (e.g., `nginx:latest`)
        - **Port**: The port your application listens on (e.g., `80`)
        - **Replicas**: Number of instances to run (default: 1)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy">
        Click **Create Deployment** to start your application.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Tab title="From GitHub">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a new deployment">
        In your project, click **New Deployment**.

      <Step title="Select 'From GitHub'">
        Choose the **From GitHub** option.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure your deployment">
        - **Name**: A unique name for this deployment
        - **Repository URL**: Your GitHub repository URL
        - **Branch**: The branch to build from (e.g., `main`)
        - **Dockerfile Path**: Path to your Dockerfile (e.g., `./Dockerfile`)
        - **Port**: The port your application listens on
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy">
        Click **Create Deployment**. Orchard will clone your repository, build the image, and deploy it.

    </Steps>
  </Tab>

## Step 5: Expose Your Application

To make your application accessible from the internet, you need to create a service and optionally an ingress.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a service">
    In your deployment's **Networking** tab, click **Add Service**. Choose **External** to expose it publicly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Add a custom domain">
    To use your own domain, create an **Ingress** and configure your DNS to point to the cluster.
  </Step>
</Steps>
