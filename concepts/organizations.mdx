description: Organizations are the top-level container for all your Orchard resources.

Organizations are the root of Orchard's resource hierarchy. They represent your team, company, or personal account and contain all your workspaces, projects, and deployments.

<Note>
  Orchard is currently in **closed beta**. Organizations are created by the Hack Club team, and you need an invitation to join one.
</Note>

## What is an Organization?

An organization is a container that:

- Groups all related workspaces and projects together
- Manages team membership and roles
- Provides a unique slug for URL identification
- Can have an avatar and description for identification

## Organization Hierarchy

```
Organization (e.g., "Acme Corp")
├── Workspace (e.g., "Production")
│   ├── Project (e.g., "API")
│   └── Project (e.g., "Web App")
└── Workspace (e.g., "Staging")
    └── Project (e.g., "API")
```

## Joining an Organization

During the closed beta, you need an invitation to join an organization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive an invitation">
    An organization admin will send you an invitation via email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the invitation link">
    Open the email and click **Accept Invitation**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in or create account">
    If you don't have an account, you'll be prompted to create one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access granted">
    You'll be added to the organization with the role specified in the invitation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organization Roles

Members of an organization can have one of three roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the organization, including deletion. Cannot be removed. |
| **Admin** | Can manage members, workspaces, and settings. Cannot delete the organization. |
| **Member** | Can access workspaces they've been invited to. Cannot manage organization settings. |

## Managing Members

### Inviting Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open organization settings">
    Navigate to your organization and click **Settings** or the members section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Invite Member'">
    Enter the email address of the person you want to invite.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a role">
    Choose the appropriate role (Owner, Admin, or Member).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send invitation">
    The invited person will receive an email with a link to join. Invitations expire after 7 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Existing Members

From the members list, you can:

- **Change roles**: Click on a member's role to update it
- **Remove members**: Click the remove button to revoke access (owners cannot be removed)
- **View pending invitations**: See and resend invitations that haven't been accepted

<Note>
  Removing a member from an organization also removes them from all workspaces within that organization.
</Note>

## Organization Settings

### Basic Information

You can update your organization's:

- **Name**: The display name of your organization
- **Description**: A brief description visible to members
- **Avatar**: Upload an image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP, max 5MB)

### Danger Zone

From the organization settings, you can also:

- **Transfer ownership**: Assign another admin as the owner
- **Delete organization**: Permanently remove the organization and all its contents

<Warning>
  Deleting an organization is permanent and will remove all workspaces, projects, deployments, and data within it. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use one organization per team or company">
    Keep all related projects within a single organization for easier access management and billing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Choose clear, recognizable names for your organization that team members will easily identify.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set up roles appropriately">
    Only grant admin or owner roles to people who need to manage the organization structure. Most team members should be regular members.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use workspaces for environment separation">
    Instead of creating separate organizations for staging and production, use workspaces within a single organization.
  </Accordion>
