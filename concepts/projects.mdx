description: Projects contain your deployments and are isolated in their own Kubernetes namespace.
---

Projects are the lowest level of Orchard's organizational hierarchy. Each project gets its own Kubernetes namespace, providing complete isolation from other projects.

## What is a Project?

A project is a container that:

- Holds all your deployments for a specific application or service
- Has its own isolated Kubernetes namespace
- Contains services, ingresses, and volumes for its deployments
- Can be linked to a GitHub repository for automated builds

## Project Isolation

Each project runs in its own Kubernetes namespace. The namespace name is automatically generated from your organization, workspace, and project slugs:

```
{organization-slug}-{workspace-slug}-{project-slug}
```

For example, if you have:
- Organization: `acme-corp`
- Workspace: `production`
- Project: `api`

The Kubernetes namespace would be: `acme-corp-production-api`

This isolation means:
- Deployments in one project cannot directly access deployments in another
- Resources (CPU, memory) are isolated
- Network policies can be applied per-project
- Secrets and configuration are scoped to the project

## Creating a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your workspace">
    Open the workspace where you want to create the project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'New Project'">
    Click the **New Project** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter project details">
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your project (e.g., "API", "Web App", "Worker")
    - **Slug**: Auto-generated URL identifier
    - **Description** (optional): Describe what this project contains
    - **Repository URL** (optional): Link to your GitHub repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create** to set up your project. Orchard will automatically create the corresponding Kubernetes namespace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Projects Contain

A project can contain:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deployments" icon="server">
    Running containers from Docker images or built from source code
  </Card>
  <Card title="Services" icon="network-wired">
    Network endpoints for accessing your deployments internally or externally
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ingresses" icon="globe">
    HTTP(S) routing rules for custom domains
  </Card>
  <Card title="Volumes" icon="database">
    Persistent storage for data that survives container restarts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Project Structure Example

```
Project: API
├── Deployments
│   ├── api-server (main API container)
│   └── worker (background job processor)
├── Services
│   ├── api-server (ClusterIP - internal)
│   └── api-server-external (LoadBalancer - public)
├── Ingresses
│   └── api.example.com → api-server:8080
└── Volumes
    └── data-volume (PVC for persistent data)
```

## Linking a GitHub Repository

You can optionally link a GitHub repository to your project. This enables:

- One-click deployments from your repository
- Automatic branch and Dockerfile detection
- Build history tracking with commit references

To link a repository:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open project settings">
    Navigate to your project and click **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add repository URL">
    Enter your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-org/your-repo`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to link the repository.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  For private repositories, you'll need to configure GitHub access in your user settings.
</Note>

## Project Permissions

Project access is controlled at the workspace level. If you have access to a workspace, you can access all projects within it based on your workspace role:

| Workspace Role | Project Permissions |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to all projects, including deletion |
| **Editor** | Can create, modify, and delete deployments in all projects |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to all projects |

## Deleting a Project

<Warning>
  Deleting a project permanently removes all deployments, services, ingresses, volumes, and the Kubernetes namespace. This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

To delete a project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open project settings">
    Navigate to the project and click **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to danger zone">
    Scroll down to the danger zone section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete">
    Click **Delete Project** and confirm by typing the project name.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One service per project">
    For microservices architectures, consider creating one project per service. This provides better isolation and independent deployment cycles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Group related deployments">
    If you have an API and a worker that are tightly coupled, keep them in the same project so they can communicate easily.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name your projects clearly so team members know what they contain (e.g., "user-api" instead of "service1").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Link your repository">
    Always link your GitHub repository for easier deployments and better tracking of what code is running.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
