title: Workspaces
description: Workspaces group related projects together within an organization.

Workspaces are the second level of Orchard's hierarchy, sitting between organizations and projects. They help you organize projects by environment, team, or any other logical grouping.

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a logical container that:

- Groups related projects together
- Has its own member list with independent permissions
- Provides isolation between different environments or teams
- Contains projects that share a common purpose

## Common Workspace Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Environment">
    ```
    Organization: Acme Corp
    ├── Workspace: Production
    │   ├── Project: API
    │   ├── Project: Web App
    │   └── Project: Worker
    ├── Workspace: Staging
    │   ├── Project: API
    │   └── Project: Web App
    └── Workspace: Development
        └── Project: Sandbox
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Team">
    ```
    Organization: Acme Corp
    ├── Workspace: Backend Team
    │   ├── Project: API
    │   └── Project: Database Service
    ├── Workspace: Frontend Team
    │   └── Project: Web App
    └── Workspace: Infrastructure
        ├── Project: Monitoring
        └── Project: Logging
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Product">
    ```
    Organization: Acme Corp
    ├── Workspace: Product A
    │   ├── Project: API
    │   └── Project: Web
    └── Workspace: Product B
        ├── Project: API
        └── Project: Mobile Backend
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your organization">
    From the dashboard, select the organization where you want to create a workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'New Workspace'">
    Click the **New Workspace** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter workspace details">
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for the workspace (e.g., "Production", "Backend Team")
    - **Slug**: Auto-generated URL identifier
    - **Description** (optional): Describe the purpose of this workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create** to set up your workspace. You'll automatically become an admin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace Roles

Workspace permissions are independent from organization roles. A member of an organization must be explicitly invited to a workspace to access its projects.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full control over the workspace, including managing members and deleting projects |
| **Editor** | Can create, modify, and delete deployments. Cannot manage workspace settings or members. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access. Can view deployments and logs but cannot make changes. |

<Note>
  Organization admins and owners can access all workspaces by default, but regular organization members must be explicitly invited to each workspace.
</Note>

## Managing Workspace Members

### Inviting Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workspace settings">
    Navigate to your workspace and click **Settings** or the members tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite a member">
    Select an organization member to invite, or enter an email for someone not yet in the organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign a role">
    Choose the appropriate workspace role (Admin, Editor, or Viewer).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Updating Member Roles

You can change a member's role at any time:

1. Go to the workspace members list
2. Click on the member's current role
3. Select the new role from the dropdown

### Removing Members

To remove someone from a workspace:

1. Find them in the members list
2. Click the remove button
3. Confirm the removal

<Note>
  Removing someone from a workspace doesn't remove them from the organization. They can be re-invited to the workspace later.
</Note>

## Workspace Settings

### Basic Information

Update your workspace's:

- **Name**: The display name
- **Description**: Purpose or scope of the workspace
- **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier (changing this will update all URLs)

### Deleting a Workspace

<Warning>
  Deleting a workspace will permanently remove all projects, deployments, services, and data within it. This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

To delete a workspace:

1. Go to workspace settings
2. Scroll to the danger zone
3. Click **Delete Workspace**
4. Confirm by typing the workspace name

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Separate environments with workspaces">
    Use different workspaces for production, staging, and development to prevent accidental changes to production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful names">
    Name workspaces clearly so team members know their purpose at a glance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit admin access">
    Only grant admin roles to people who need to manage the workspace structure. Most developers should be editors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use viewers for read-only access">
    Give the viewer role to stakeholders who need to monitor deployments but shouldn't make changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
