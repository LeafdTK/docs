description: Invite team members and manage access with role-based permissions.
---

Orchard provides comprehensive team collaboration features. You can invite team members to organizations and workspaces, each with specific roles that control what they can access and modify.

## Permission Hierarchy

Orchard uses a two-level permission system:

```
Organization Level
├── Owner (full control)
├── Admin (manage members and settings)
└── Member (basic access)

Workspace Level
├── Admin (full workspace control)
├── Editor (create and modify deployments)
└── Viewer (read-only access)
```

## Organization Roles

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full organization control | All permissions, including deletion |
| **Admin** | Organization management | Manage members, settings, workspaces |
| **Member** | Basic membership | Access invited workspaces only |

<Note>
  Organization members must be explicitly invited to workspaces. Being an organization member doesn't automatically grant workspace access (except for admins and owners).
</Note>

## Workspace Roles

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full workspace control | Manage members, all projects, settings |
| **Editor** | Active contributor | Create, modify, delete deployments |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access | View deployments, logs, and settings |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use least privilege">
    Give members the minimum role needed for their tasks. Start with Viewer and upgrade as needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separate environments">
    Use different workspaces for production and staging. Give broader access to staging and restrict production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review access regularly">
    Periodically review member lists and remove people who no longer need access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive workspace names">
    Name workspaces clearly (Production, Staging, Development) so access decisions are obvious.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document role assignments">
    Keep a record of why certain people have elevated access for audit purposes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Email Notifications

Members receive email notifications for:

- Organization invitations
- Workspace invitations
- Role changes
- Removal from organization or workspace

<Note>
  Email notifications are sent automatically. Make sure members check their spam folder if they don't receive invitations.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invitation not received">
    If someone doesn't receive their invitation:

    1. Check their spam folder
    2. Verify the email address is correct
    3. Resend the invitation from pending invitations
    4. Have them check pending invitations in their dashboard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't access workspace">
    If a member can't access a workspace:

    1. Verify they're invited to the specific workspace
    2. Check their workspace role
    3. Ensure they've accepted the organization invitation first
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't remove owner">
    Organization owners cannot be removed. To change ownership:

    1. Have the owner transfer ownership to another admin
    2. Then the former owner can be removed or have their role changed
