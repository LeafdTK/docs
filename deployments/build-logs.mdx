description: Monitor and debug your deployment builds with real-time logs.
---

When deploying from GitHub, Orchard provides real-time build logs so you can monitor progress and debug any issues that arise during the build process.

## Accessing Build Logs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your deployment">
    Navigate to the deployment you want to monitor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the Logs tab">
    Click on the **Logs** tab to view build output.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor in real-time">
    For active builds, logs stream in real-time. For completed builds, you'll see the full log history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Stages

Build logs are organized by stage. Each stage shows its status and detailed output:

### 1. Cloning

```
[INFO] Cloning repository...
[INFO] Repository: https://github.com/org/repo
[INFO] Branch: main
[INFO] Receiving objects: 100% (156/156)
[INFO] Clone completed successfully
```

This stage downloads your code from GitHub. Progress is shown as a percentage for large repositories.

### 2. Building

```
[INFO] Building Docker image...
[INFO] Step 1/8 : FROM node:20-alpine
[INFO] ---> abc123def456
[INFO] Step 2/8 : WORKDIR /app
[INFO] ---> Running in xyz789
[INFO] Step 3/8 : COPY package*.json ./
...
[INFO] Successfully built abc123def456
```

This stage runs `docker build` with your Dockerfile. You'll see each Dockerfile instruction executed.

### 3. Pushing

```
[INFO] Pushing image to registry...
[INFO] The push refers to repository [harbor.1mp.dev/orchard/myproject-mydeployment]
[INFO] abc123: Pushed
[INFO] def456: Pushed
[INFO] Push completed: harbor.1mp.dev/orchard/myproject-mydeployment:20231225-143022
```

This stage uploads your built image to Orchard's private registry.

### 4. Deploying

```
[INFO] Deploying to Kubernetes...
[INFO] Creating/updating deployment: mydeployment
[INFO] Deployment updated successfully
[INFO] Waiting for pods to be ready...
[INFO] Pod mydeployment-abc123 is running
```

This stage creates or updates the Kubernetes resources.

## Log Levels

Logs are color-coded by level:

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **INFO** | Normal progress information |
| **WARNING** | Non-critical issues that might need attention |
| **ERROR** | Errors that may cause the build to fail |

## Common Build Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone failed: Repository not found">
    ```
    [ERROR] Failed to clone repository
    [ERROR] Repository not found or access denied
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the repository URL is correct
    - For private repos, check that GitHub access is configured
    - Ensure you have permission to access the repository
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clone failed: Branch not found">
    ```
    [ERROR] Failed to clone repository
    [ERROR] Branch 'feature-branch' not found
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - Check that the branch name is spelled correctly
    - Verify the branch exists in the repository
    - Try using the default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build failed: Dockerfile not found">
    ```
    [ERROR] Build failed
    [ERROR] Cannot locate Dockerfile at ./Dockerfile
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - Check the Dockerfile path in your deployment settings
    - Ensure the Dockerfile exists at the specified path
    - Verify the file is named exactly `Dockerfile` (case-sensitive)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build failed: COPY failed">
    ```
    [ERROR] Step 5/8 : COPY src/ ./src/
    [ERROR] COPY failed: file not found in build context
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - Enable "Build From Root" if the file is outside the Dockerfile directory
    - Verify the path exists in your repository
    - Check for typos in the path
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build failed: npm install errors">
    ```
    [ERROR] npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
    [ERROR] npm ERR! ERESOLVE could not resolve dependency tree
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your package.json for dependency conflicts
    - Try using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in your Dockerfile
    - Ensure your lockfile is committed and up to date
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push failed: Registry error">
    ```
    [ERROR] Failed to push image
    [ERROR] Error from registry: timeout
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - This is usually a temporary issue
    - Try rebuilding after a few minutes
    - If persistent, check for large image sizes that may cause timeouts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging Tips

### Check the Dockerfile Locally

Before pushing to Orchard, test your Dockerfile locally:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t myapp .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
```

### Reduce Build Times

Large builds can timeout. To speed up builds:

1. **Use multi-stage builds** to reduce final image size
2. **Order Dockerfile commands** from least to most frequently changed
3. **Use .dockerignore** to exclude unnecessary files:

```
node_modules
.git
*.md
.env*
```

### View Historical Logs

Build logs are preserved for each build. To view logs from a previous build:

1. Go to your deployment's **History** tab
2. Click on a previous build
3. View the logs for that specific build

## Container Logs

In addition to build logs, you can view runtime container logs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your deployment">
    Navigate to your deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Logs tab">
    Click on the **Logs** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select container logs">
    Switch to view container/pod logs instead of build logs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Container logs show your application's stdout and stderr output.
