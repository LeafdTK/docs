Orchard supports multiple authentication methods to keep your account secure while providing a seamless sign-in experience.

## Authentication Methods

### Email One-Time Password (OTP)

The simplest way to sign in is with your email address. Orchard sends you a 6-digit code that you enter to verify your identity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your email">
    On the sign-in page, enter your email address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your inbox">
    You'll receive an email with a 6-digit verification code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the code">
    Type the code into the verification field to complete sign-in.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  OTP codes expire after a short time. If your code expires, request a new one.
</Note>

### Passkeys (WebAuthn)

Passkeys provide passwordless authentication using your device's biometrics or security key. This is the most secure and convenient authentication method.

**Supported passkey types:**
- Face ID / Touch ID (Apple devices)
- Windows Hello
- Hardware security keys (YubiKey, etc.)
- Android biometrics

    On the sign-in page, click the Hack Club sign-in button.

## Managing Your Sessions

When you sign in, Orchard creates a session that lasts for 7 days. You can sign out at any time from the user menu.

## Security Features

### Rate Limiting

To protect against brute force attacks, Orchard limits the number of authentication attempts:

- OTP requests are rate-limited per email address
- Passkey attempts are rate-limited per IP address
- After too many failed attempts, you'll need to wait before trying again

### Secure Cookies

Session tokens are stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies that can't be accessed by JavaScript. This protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Managing Passkeys

You can manage your registered passkeys from your user settings:

- **View passkeys**: See all registered passkeys with their names and last used dates
- **Remove passkeys**: Delete passkeys you no longer use
- **Add new passkeys**: Register additional devices for backup access

<Warning>
  Always keep at least one authentication method available. If you remove all passkeys and lose access to your email, you won't be able to recover your account.
</Warning>
